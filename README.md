Hackathon1 Problem solution
Constraints:

    All your HTML elements should be created with DOM.
    Use the async/await.
    Use try-catch to handle errors.
    Use fetch() to get the data from Open Brewery API
    All JavaScript codes should be in a script file named script.js which has to be imported in your HTML page.
    Implement a search filter based on the text entered in the input field.

How do I process the API data?

    Display the breweries name and type.
    Display the breweryâ€™s address.
    Also display the website url.
    Display the phone no of the brewery.
